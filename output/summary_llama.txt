LLAMA-POWERED RISK ANALYSIS SUMMARY
==================================

✅ Llama analysis found no significant risks or uncertainties.

--- ✅ Mitigated Risks ---
The following potential issues were analyzed and appear to be mitigated by the contract:

  - NCC Title: Non-Compliant Paint System
    Llama's Reasoning: The new contract requirement, 'The marine-grade paint system shall provide superior protection against corrosion,' specifically addresses the past failure of exterior paint failing salt spray tests required for coastal operation. By specifying a marine-grade paint system that provides superior corrosion protection, the risk of similar failures is mitigated.

  - NCC Title: Fire Protection Standard Misinterpreted
    Llama's Reasoning: The new contract requirement to comply with EN 45545 Hazard Level 3 (HL3) addresses the past failure, which was due to the design following HL2 instead of HL3. By mandating compliance with HL3, the risk of using materials that do not meet the required hazard level is significantly reduced.

  - NCC Title: Insufficient EMC Shielding
    Llama's Reasoning: The new contract requirement specifically highlights the importance of electromagnetic compatibility, which was a root cause of the past failure. By emphasizing EMC shielding, the requirement directly addresses the issue that led to interference in the train's communication system. This should effectively mitigate the risk of similar failures occurring in the future.
